Low budget antenna analyzer &amp; DDS with AD9850, Arduino and a small OLED

The idea for this analyzer and first documentation I found on http://www.hamstack.com/project_antenna_analyzer.html. Beric Dunn (K6BEZ) did a great job with this analyzer.

My project extends the original analyzer by three buttons, a small OLED (128x64) and a tiny speaker to control and operate without a PC.

Since I am not a professional programmer you may not to use my code to learn how to do it right. ;-)

Key features are:

* Menue to operate with three buttons with
- Graph or text mode
- Start- and stop frequence, sweep steps

* Optional speaker sound on hold frequence with a higher and faster beeps at better SWR (in textmode).

* Simple calibration function 

* Store measures VSWR, start- and end frequency, sweep steps in eeprom.

* and for sure optionaly you can use the USB interface to measure, too.

The absolute SWR may not very accurate. But in relative the measure is fine. :)

Atm missing is a detailed information about how to operate (button functions) and the wiring info.

If you are interested please let me know!

Best regards,
Stephan (dc8lz)
